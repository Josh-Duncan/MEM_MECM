# Microsoft-Endpoint-Management
Scripts and tools for Microsoft Endpoint Manager and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

This is a mostly PowerShell project, but there are scripts and configuration files for macOS, and eventually Linux (if it ever gets released).

Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/Josh-Duncan/MEM_MECM/wiki/) for more information on the scripts and how they're set up and used.

Please feel free to let me know if there are any issues or requests for anything that is published by using the [Issues](https://github.com/Josh-Duncan/Microsoft-Endpoint-Management/issues) section, or by reacing out to me directly.
